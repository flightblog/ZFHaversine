# ZFHaversine #

Objective-C implementation of the Haversine formula and Spherical Law of Cosines used to find the distance between two GPS coordinates.  Also, methods are available to find initial and final bearing from GPS coordinates.


### Haversine ###
The haversine formula is an equation important in navigation, giving great-circle distances between two 
points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes. It is a special case of a more general formula 
in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, relating the sides and angles of spherical triangles. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

### Spherical Law of Cosines ###
In spherical trigonometry, the law of cosines (also called the cosine rule for sides) is a theorem 
relating the sides and angles of spherical triangles, analogous to the ordinary law of cosines from 
plane trigonometry. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines)

### Equirectangular Approximation
"If performance is an issue and accuracy less important, for small distances Pythagoras’ theorem can be used on an equirectangular projection." \- http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html

### Usage ###
    
    
    // Test coordinates
    
    // Nantucket Memorial Airport (KACK)
    CGFloat latitude1 = 41.2531111;
    CGFloat longitude1 = -70.0603056;
    
    // Block Island Airport (KBID)
    CGFloat latitude2 = 41.1681111;
    CGFloat longitude2 =  -71.5778333;

    // Logan International Airport (KBOS)
    CGFloat latitude1 = 42.3629722;
    CGFloat longitude1 = -71.0064167;
    
    // San Francisco International (KSFO)
    CGFloat latitude2 = 37.6191050;
    CGFloat longitude2 = -122.3752372;
    
    // Setup
    ZFHaversine *distanceAndBearing = [[ZFHaversine alloc] init];
    [distanceAndBearing setLatitude1:latitude1];
    [distanceAndBearing setLongitude1:longitude1];
    [distanceAndBearing setLatitude2:latitude2];
    [distanceAndBearing setLongitude2:longitude2];
    
    // Setup with coordinates
    ZFHaversine *distanceAndBearing = [[ZFHaversine alloc] initWithLatitude1:latitude1
                                                                  longitude1:longitude1
                                                                   latitude2:latitude2
                                                                  longitude2:longitude2];
    
    // __Optional__: Change the default distance formula from Haversine to the Spherical Law Of Cosines
    [distanceAndBearing setFormulaMode:sphericalFormula];

    // ... or the equirectangular approximation distance formula
    // Note: with this formula, the further apart the two points are,
    // the more incorrect the distance gets
    //[distanceAndBearing setFormulaMode:equirectangularFormula];

    // Results for Distance    
    NSLog(@"Kilos %f", [distanceAndBearing kilos]);
    NSLog(@"Meters %f", [distanceAndBearing meters]);
    NSLog(@"Nautial Miles %f", [distanceAndBearing nauticalMiles]);
    NSLog(@"Miles %f", [distanceAndBearing miles]);
    NSLog(@"Yards %f", [distanceAndBearing yards]);
    NSLog(@"Feet %f", [distanceAndBearing feet]);
    
    // Results for Initial and Final Bearing
    NSLog(@"Initial Bearing %f", [distanceAndBearing initialBearing]);
    NSLog(@"Final Bearing %f", [distanceAndBearing finalBearing]);
    
    

### TODO:

* Add option to use Equirectangular approximation distance formula
* Unit test
